For this analysis, unsupervised machine learning methods were applied to identify clusters in observed price changes for crypto currency. The KMeans method was used on 2 variations of the data, in the first the original data was scaled with all factors included and in the second data set the scaled data was limited to 3 PC's. Both results show clear groups of Cluster segments. However, the PCA cluster analysis shows another outlier data point as the 3rd cluster and shows better visually as the point is separated from the rest of the data, whereas the cluster analysis on more components showed the 3rd cluster within an already grouped cluster segment.
